# Geography

This unimaginatively named webapp was created primarily as a way to document past trips (including with photos). Users can also plan future trips by finding out information about a country (via a RESTful API) and inviting other users on that trip. There is also an educational and fun `play page` which tests a user's knowledge of countries around the world.

Built using the Ruby on Rails framework and a simple HTML/CSS/JS front-end. I have been using the app as a playground to learn more about Rails.
